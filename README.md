# es6-flex-masonry-grid
ES6 Module for displaying items in a flex-based masonry layout without third party dependencies. The grid layout only uses the css flexbox feature. In contrast to well-known masonry layouts there is no absolute positioning which makes it usable for various css frameworks. The distances are calculated using a simple transform style (translateY).
